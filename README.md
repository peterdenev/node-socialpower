### project scope

Simple web based multiplayer game involving all the mentioned above buzz words in soup of fun and glorious hacking. 

#### How it is played

Every registered player should be able to gain points.

Points are collected once the player sends something interesting via the game UI and someone else from the game UI reshare it.

As many reshares there are as many points are given to the player who originally send the interesting message. Every player who sends or reshares recieve points.

Every day on midnight the game room is closed and a player with the top score wins. If there is equality among two or more players, they all are promoted as winners. 

Then highscores table of top winning players are kept up to date.
Optionally messages can be broadcasted to authorized 3rd party apps - twitter/facebook.
